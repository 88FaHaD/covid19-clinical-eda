# COVID-19 Clinical Trials Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook project conducts an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of COVID-19 clinical trials data. The analysis focuses on understanding trial characteristics, status distribution, study phases, demographic focus, and temporal trends in COVID-19 related research.

## Features
- **Data Loading & Initial Exploration**: Loads the clinical trials dataset and provides an initial preview.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values, drops irrelevant columns, and fills remaining missing data.
- **Univariate Analysis**: Examines trial status distribution and study phases.
- **Visualizations**: Creates informative plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Temporal Analysis**: Investigates trends in trial start dates and completion timelines.

## Libraries Used
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Datetime**: Date handling and manipulation.

## Key Steps
1. **Data Loading**: Loads the COVID-19 clinical trials dataset and checks basic information.
2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Drops columns with >70% missing data.
   - Fills missing values in key columns.
   - Verifies cleaning results.
3. **Initial Exploration**:
   - Examines dataset shape and structure.
   - Provides summary statistics for numerical and categorical columns.
4. **Univariate Analysis**:
   - Analyzes distribution of trial statuses.
   - Investigates study phases breakdown.
5. **Visualizations**:
   - Creates bar plots for trial status and phase distributions.
   - Uses professional styling for publication-ready figures.

## Insights
- Identifies the most common trial statuses and phases.
- Reveals patterns in trial characteristics and demographics.
- Highlights data completeness and quality issues.

## Future Work
- Incorporate additional datasets for comparative analysis.
- Perform multivariate analysis to identify relationships between trial characteristics.
- Develop predictive models for trial outcomes.
- Create interactive visualizations for enhanced data exploration.
